# Computational Condensed Matter Physics research group

Welcome to the github organization of the reseach group led by Andrés Camilo García Castro, professor at Universidad Industrial de Santander. We are currently working on chiral systems, focusing on their relationship with topology and magnetism from the electronic and phonic perspective. Also, we are working in the charge density wave (CDW) phenomena. We invite you to wander around and learn about [our research](https://github.com/Garcia-Castro-Group/.github/wiki/Research) and [members](https://github.com/Garcia-Castro-Group/.github/wiki/Members).
